- Using the command `make run` the project will be built and executed.
- Infix expressions in the format: "a = XX + II * (M - IV)" can be entered, one
  per line.
- Entering a blank line will end the input sequence, and produce the output
  for all statements entered.

Everything works properly for this assignment. I've extensively tested the
program's handling of input to ensure that invalid numerals aren't calculated.

Some fatal errors (such as an invalid infix expressions) result in the termination
of the program, while other non-fatal errors (such as an invalid numeral,
i.e. XXXX or numerals >= MMMM) only result in that input line being skipped, with
the user being allowed to continue entering expressions.

Exit code 0: OK
Exit code 1: expression was entered without a left-hand variable
Exit code 2: expression wasn't an assignment
